# Image-Recognition-and-Joint-Detection-for-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is our project for Image Recognition and Joint detection for Rock Paper Scissors. The preprocessing folder contains all of the code to push our expanded dataset to Hugging Face. The code in this folder should not be run. All other files implement models either discussed in the paper or listed as attempted but not discussed. We suggest uploading the code to Google Colab before running, as that is the environment we wrote the code in and it guarentees the correct installations are available. However, the demo must be run on your local computer. Make sure to run "pip install" on all relevant imports to run the code. Specifically, make sure to run "pip install gdown." The final paper is also included in this repository.
