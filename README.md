# Image-Recognition-and-Joint-Detection-for-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is our project for Image Recognition and Joint detection for Rock Paper Scissors. The preprocessing folder contains all of the code to push our expanded dataset to Hugging Face. The code in this folder should not be run as our expanded dataset has already been uploaded to Hugging Face. The latex folder contains the source files for creating our Latex paper. All other files implement models either discussed in the paper or attempted but not discussed. Extra plots, data, and other findings are included in these files. We suggest uploading the code to Google Colab before running, as that is the environment we wrote the code in and it guarentees the correct installations are available. However, the demo must be run on your local computer. Note that mediapipe only works on python 3.10 in its current version, so make sure to have that version of python installed before attempting to use mediapipe. Make sure to run "pip install" on all relevant imports to run the code. Specifically, make sure to run "pip install gdown" and "pip install opencv-python." The final paper is also included in this repository, named "Image Recognition and Joint Detection for Rock Paper Scissors.pdf."
